## Color Scheme

-the slightly off-white primary color goes with a lot of different colors but still gives a more aesthetic/warmer vibe when compared to just plain white
green allows the user to maintain a calm feeling/vibe

-dark brown is a pretty contrasting color when compared to green that can bring attention to different aspects of the app when needed

-dull semantic colors allows the app to not break the focus of the user and maintain that calm vibe that the green color is for

-brighter colors (ex: bright red when getting something wrong) may also discourage the user and make them feel a bit bad

### Why these colors?

I tried to create a very calm atmosphere through the color schemes by choosing dull color tones. I hope that it is able to calm the test taker and enable them to get the most accurate results whereas the results could some what change if the color scheme was too distracting and bright.
