## Color Scheme

-the slightly off-white primary color goes with a lot of different colors but still gives a more aesthetic/warmer vibe when compared to just plain white
green allows the user to maintain a calm feeling/vibe

-dark brown is a pretty contrasting color when compared to green that can bring attention to different aspects of the app when needed

-dull semantic colors allows the app to not break the focus of the user and maintain that calm vibe that the green color is for

-brighter colors (ex: bright red when getting something wrong) may also discourage the user and make them feel a bit bad

I chose to make the corners of the boxes a bit rounder to make a softer look rather than harsh edges. This goes along with my efforts to make a calming atmosphere for the app.
