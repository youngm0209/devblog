### What is Cognitive Reserve?

Cognitive reserve is one's brain's ability to approach a task in various ways and change how the brain operates when met with that task. This concept of cognitive reserve emerged in the the 1980s when scientists found people with no signs of dementia but displayed changes of the brain that looked very similar to those that would advance dementia: these individuals were able to live normally because of their large cognitive reserve.

Cognitive reserve ultimately allows individuals to function better when met with unexpected life situations and also succumb slower to the changes that occur with dementia and other brain-related conditions.
