## Introduction

---
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a test used by healthcare providers to evaluate people with memory loss or other symptoms of cognitive decline. It can help identify those at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. It is also used as a screening tool for conditions like Parkinson's disease, brain tumors, substance abuse, and head trauma.

This review systematic and meta-analysis found that the MMSE
is the most frequently studied test for dementia screening.
However, many other screening tests have comparable diag-
nostic performance. The Mini-Cog test and the ACE-R had bet-
ter performance than the other dementia screening tests. The
MoCA had better performance than the other MCI screening
tests. Although the MMSE is a proprietary instrument for de-
mentia screening, the other screening tests are comparably ef-
fective but easier to perform and freely available.
