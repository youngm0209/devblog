## Introduction

---
The MoCA test, also known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, is utilized to detect mild cognitive impairiment (MCI) early on. It serves to identify people who are at risk of developing different types of dementia like Alzheimer's disease or condidtions like Parkinson's disease and brain tumors. The test itself includes 30 questions total which will evaluate whether the person taking the test shows signs of MCI. Although it is a useful test, it does need to be taken with other cognitive tests in order to confirm diagnosis of diseases or conditions.

This review systematic and meta-analysis found that the MMSE
is the most frequently studied test for dementia screening.
However, many other screening tests have comparable diag-
nostic performance. The Mini-Cog test and the ACE-R had bet-
ter performance than the other dementia screening tests. The
MoCA had better performance than the other MCI screening
tests. Although the MMSE is a proprietary instrument for de-
mentia screening, the other screening tests are comparably ef-
fective but easier to perform and freely available.
