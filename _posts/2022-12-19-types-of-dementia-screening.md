## What is MoCA?

---
The MoCA test, also known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, is utilized to detect mild cognitive impairiment (MCI) early on. It serves to identify people who are at risk of developing different types of dementia like Alzheimer's disease or conditions like Parkinson's disease and brain tumors. The test itself includes 30 questions total which will evaluate whether the person taking the test shows signs of MCI. Although the MoCA is a useful test, additional cognitive tests must be used in order to confirm diagnosis of diseases or conditions.

### Orientation

The test taker's orientation is evaluated by asking them to state the date, month, year, day, place, and city of when and where they are taking the test, and this category is out of 6 points.

### Delayed Recall

In order to check the test taker's delayed recall, the administrator reads five words, and the test taker is asked to repeat them. After the test taker completes a series of various tasks, they are asked to repeat the same five words. If they are unable to do so, they are given hints, and this category is out of 5 points.

### Visuospatial Ability

#### Trails B Test

The Trails B Test is utilized to check both the test taker's visuospatial and  executive function ability. It asks the test taker to connect mixed letters and numbers in a certain order and draw a cube. These two tasks are worth 2 points in total.

#### Clock Drawing Test

The Clock Drawing Test is also used to test the test taker's visuospatial ability, and they are asked to draw a certain time on the clock.

## How does the MoCA compare with other tests?

---

The MoCA test is pretty similar to the more widely used test, MMSE as they both revolve around a 30 point system and are quick to complete. However, the MMSE is shorter than the MoCA, and the former does not use some tests that the latter does such as the clock test. When compared to the MMSE, the MoCA test is better at detecting milder diseases because of its sensitive executive function, meaning that the MMSE is better for people with more obvious symptoms while the MoCA test is better for people with milder symptoms. Also, unlike the MMSE, the MoCA test is free to use for all people.
