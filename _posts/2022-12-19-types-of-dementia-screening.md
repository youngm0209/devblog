## Introduction

---
The MoCA test, also known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, is utilized to detect mild cognitive impairiment (MCI) early on. It serves to identify people who are at risk of developing different types of dementia like Alzheimer's disease or conditions like Parkinson's disease and brain tumors. The test itself includes 30 questions total which will evaluate whether the person taking the test shows signs of MCI. Although the MoCA is a useful test, it does need to be taken with other cognitive tests in order to confirm diagnosis of diseases or conditions.

The MoCA tests 8 different types of cognitive abilities: orientation, short-term memory, executive function, language, abstraction, animal naming, attention, and clock drawing. The test is out of 30 points, and a score of 26 points or higher is considered normal. The MoCA test is pretty similar to the more widely used test, MMSE as they both revolve around a 30 point system and are quick to complete. However, the MMSE is shorter than the MoCA, and the former does not use some tests that the latter does such as the clock test. When compared to the MMSE, the MoCA test is better at detecting milder diseases because of its sensitive executive function, meaning that the MMSE is better for people with more obvious symptoms while the MoCA test is better for people with milder symptoms. Also, unlike the MMSE, the MoCA test is free to use for all people.
