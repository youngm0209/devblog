## Why did we decide on the Mini Cog test and how does it compare to different cognitive tests?

We chose the Mini Cog test because it offers fast and reliable results which can be efficiently utilized by our app. Although it does require the test taker to consult further after taking the test with an actual docter, the quick and accurate results allow the test taker to identify signs of cognitive disorder in a easy way.

#### Who is our target demographic?

Our target demographic are the seniors who fear they are developing a cognitive disorder and do not want to tell their close family or friends.

#### How did we accomodate our app to match that demographic?

We applied a simple layout to the app, so it would be easier for seniors, who usually do not have too much experience with technology, to handle. In order to do this, we minimized the amount of buttons present on a page and made sure the flow of the overall app made sense. We also utilized the color green to create a calmer atmosphere while the elderly take tests. We also took caution with the font to ensure that it would be easy to read and nothing too illegible.

## What kind of apps already exist?

Government made apps already exist, but most of them are very complicated and have lengthy log in processes. They are not very accessible to the elderly, the sector of our society that probably needs this app the most, and overall prove to be very difficult to use. From having a many buttons to being pretty long, the tests that preexist do not entirely fit the needs of the main demographic that is need of this product.

### How does our app differ from other apps?

Our app does not have a log in process which allows the test taker to take the testwithout having to fear of being burdened by their family member or friend's knowledge on the state of their brain's condition. Overall, we as a team put in major effort to accomodate to the needs and feelings of the test takers and create an app that would ultimately allow them to feel safe and calm while taking a test that could possibly alter their life.

## What do we ultimately want to bring to the world through this app?

Our mission is to create an accessible app for those who are curious as to whether or not they have a cognitive disorder. Because our app utilizes the Mini Cog test, we are able to supply quick and accurate results to those in need. Most take takers may feel a bit cautious and afraid with the fact that they may be in risk of developing a serious cognitive disorder, so our app strives to create a test that can be done in a rather discrete manner and not put too much burden on the test taker.
