The Mini-Cog app is available on Google Play Store, and the link above directly takes you to the app. One may ask, why only make it available for Android users? Well, since the elderly who reside in South Korea mainly use Android devicees, we wanted to ensure this app would be ultimately accessible for them, as they are our target demographic.

## Simple tour of our app!

#### What do I see when I first enter the app?

A simple sentence that efficiently summarises the goal of our app: to supply a fast and efficient test that anyone and everyone can use.

##### How does it even work? 
The test taker is given three items to memorize and recall after some time. Seems simple enough, right? However, the design and flow-deciding process took a bit of time. 

There are numerous different possibilites as to how we can showcase the 3 item recall test. From showing all three words at once to showing one word at a time, the variations require much thought to be put into the overall format of this test.
