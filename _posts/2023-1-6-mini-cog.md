### What is Mini-Cog?

The Mini-Cog is a cognitive screening tool used to detect cognitive impairment. It consists of a three-item recall task and a clock drawing test. The recall task involves the patient repeating back a list of three words immediately and again after a brief delay. The clock drawing test involves the patient drawing a clock face with all the numbers in their correct positions and setting the hands to a specific time. The Mini-Cog is a quick and easy tool for healthcare professionals to use in a clinical setting to identify patients who may need further evaluation for cognitive problems.
